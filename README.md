# 🌱 SmartGrow – AI-Powered Marketing Video | Future Intern Project

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my Prompt Engineering Internship at *Future Intern*.

The goal of *Task 1* was to create a short marketing video using *AI-generated images* and *scripted text* to promote a product.

I chose to showcase *SmartGrow*, a smart gardening kit that uses sensors and automation to help users grow healthy plants effortlessly, whether indoors or outdoors.
